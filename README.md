# DataTrivium

**A refined and practical walkthrough of the foundational Python trifecta: _Pandas_, _NumPy_, and _Matplotlib_.**

This repository distills the essence of Python’s core data science stack into clean, illustrative notebooks — ideal for beginners and curious minds alike.
Based on Zero to Mastery's [Data Science Bootcamp](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp/).

---

## Libraries Covered

- **Pandas** – Tabular data manipulation made intuitive.
- **NumPy** – Fast, vectorized numerical computation.
- **Matplotlib** – Elegant plotting and data visualization.

---

## Ideal For

- Python beginners starting data science.
- Students needing a concise conceptual and practical guide.
- Self-learners seeking clarity without verbosity.

---

## Quickstart

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
Then launch the Notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```


## Why DataTrivium?
Because before one tackles deep learning or predictive modeling, one must master:

- The data (Pandas),
- The numbers (NumPy),
- And the storytelling (Matplotlib).
